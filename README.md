Wallpaper.py
---------

Uses the reddit API to download a fancy wallpaper from one of the wallpaper
dedicated subreddits. What subreddits it looks at can be modified from the
command-line. It is only able to set the desktop wallpaper on either a 
Gnome desktop or a ldxe with Nathans wallpaper setter installed. The latter
is the default in puppy linux.

xkcdBG.sh
--------

Find the latest xkcd comic, downloads it and set it as the desktop bagground.
Only works on gnome desktop at the moment.
